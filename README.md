# Scheduler Plugin

## Quick summary
Plugin which allows you to schedule an alarm which will start you app.
 
## Getting started
The plugin can be installed using the following commands (this assumes you are familiar with the [Cordova Android Getting Started] (http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.3.0/guide_platforms_android_index.md.html#Android%20Platform%20Guide)):

* cordova create hello com.example.hello "HelloWorld"
* cd hello
* cordova platform add android
* cordova plugin add https://github.com/Red-Folder/Scheduler-Plugin.git
* Amend the hello\www\config.xml, replace any existing content node with: `<content src="scheduler.html" />` (add the content node if not already present)
* cordova build

You should be able to run the example.

This is a very early version of the plugin and is under active development.

Please read the [Release Notes] (https://github.com/Red-Folder/Scheduler-Plugin/wiki/Release-Notes) between version as function signature is very likely to change while in active development.

## Spread the love

If you find the Plugin useful then spread the love.

All the work I do on the Plugin is done in my spare time - time I would otherwise be spending taking my wife out for a nice meal or helping my lad find vinyl records (he's currently very much into The Smiths, Fleetwood Mac and Kate Bush).

The Plugin is free and will always remain free. I will continue to develop, maintain and distribute the Plugin under the Apache 2.0 License.
